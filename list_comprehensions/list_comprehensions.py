MAPPING VALUES
--------------

For this section you will use a list of words, `word_list`, and perform some 
transformations on this list using list comprehensions 

If you wish to look at the words list, then you can uncomment the 
`print(word_list)` line to see it in the output.


At the moment, several new lists are created from `word_list` using `for` loops:
 
* `word_lengths_from_loop` - a list of the length of each word in word_list.
* `outer_letters_from_loop` - a list containing the first and last letter of 
                              each word in `word_list` as a string.
* `just_ones_from_loop` - a list the same length as `word_list` where every item
                          is the number 1.

You will be creating equivalent lists, but doing so using list comprehensions
instead of for loops. There are then some lines at the end of the section which
check that your result is the same.

1. Uncomment the assert and print statements at the bottom of this section
2. Replace each of the ellipses (...) in the definitions of `word_lengths`, 
   `outer_letters` and `just_ones` with a list comprehension so that these 
   variables end up as lists which are the same as their `_from_loop` equivalent.
3. Run the script. If your list comprehensions are correctly defined then you
   should be able to run it without seeing any errors.

MAPPING VALUES EXTENSION - Only do this section if you finish the above one

The variable `number_of_vowels_from_loop` below is a list which counts the 
number of vowels in each word in `word_list`. 
 
1. Uncomment the print and assert statements at the bottom of the section
2. Replace the ellipsis `...` with a list comprehension which results in 
   `number_of_vowels` being equal to `number_of_vowels_from_loop` 

Note: You may well need to write a separate function (e.g. `count_vowels`) 
to use in the list comprehension.

"""
SCOPING OF ITERATION VARIABLES
------------------------------

The code below takes a variable, `word`, and finds the number of words in 
`word_list` which start with the same letter. To do this, it iterates through 
word_list, and creates a new list where each element is `True` or `False`. 

However, there is a bug in the code which you  
can fix by using a list comprehension instead (there are other ways to fix the 
bug, but try to do it using a list comprehension). 

1. Uncomment the print and assert statements at the bottom of the section. If 
   you run the script now you should see some unexpected output. 
2. This is being caused by the iteration variable, `word`, in the for loop. 
   Replace the for loop with the line:
   
   `starts_with_same_letter = [word[0] == first_letter for word in word_list]`
    
   Note: Make sure you actually replace the `for` loop (or comment it out). If
   you just add the list comprehension below then you'll still get the error.
3. Run your script again. You should now see that the variable `word` is still
   equal to its starting value, even though the list comprehension is doing the
   same operations as the for loop
"""

# Define a variable, `word` which our program will use later
# (if you're interested, bombinate means "to make a humming or buzzing noise")
word = "bombinate"
first_letter = word[0]

# <<< CHANGE THE CODE BELOW HERE  >>>

# Create a list of booleans where each item is `True` if the corresponding word
# in word_list starts with same letter as `word`, and `False` otherwise
starts_with_same_letter = []
for word in word_list:
    starts_with_same_letter.append(word[0] == first_letter)

# <<< DO NOT CHANGE THE LINES BELOW HERE (except to uncomment) >>>

# Note: You can use the `sum` function on a list of numbers or booleans. True is
# treated as 1, and False as 0, so e.g. `sum([True, True, False, True]) == 3`
count_with_same_letter = sum(starts_with_same_letter)

# print()
# print("My favourite word is", word)

"""
THE TERNARY OPERATOR
--------------------

Replace the ellipsis (...) below with a list comprehension which contains a 
modified version of each of the words in `word_list`. This list should be 
created so:

* Every word shorter than 7 letters has the `_short` suffix.
* Every word with 7 or more letters has the `_long` suffix.

So 'skiller' goes to 'skiller_long', and 'python' goes to 'python_short'.

Uncomment the print statements at the bottom of the section, and run the script. 
"""

modified_words = ...

# print()
# print('First modified word:', modified_words[0])
# print('Last modified word:', modified_words[-1])
# print('1475th modified word:', modified_words[1474])


"""
FILTERING VALUES
----------------

In the code below use list comprehensions to create three lists that are subsets
of `word_list`.

* `list_a` - should contain all the words in `word_list` that are 3 letters long
* `list_b` - should contain all the words in `word_list` that have more than
             8 letters, and end with the letter 'c'
* `list_c` - should contain all the words in `word_list` that have fewer than 
             5 letters, start with the letter 'a', and contain the letter 't'
             (e.g. 'arts')

#       "words shorter than 5 letters, which start with a, and contain t:")

"""
COMBINING MAPPING AND FILTERING
-------------------------------

Replace the ellipsis in the code below with a single list comprehension so that 
`reversed_long_words` contains reversed versions of all the words in `word_list`
that are more than 13 letters long. 

So for example, if `listcomprehension` were in `word_list`, then 
`reversed_long_words` would contain the string `'noisneherpmoctsil'.

NOTE: A string can be reversed using slicing:

    >>> a_string = 'hello'
    >>> a_string[::-1]
    ... 'olleh' 

Uncomment the print statements, and make sure that your script runs successfully
and that the result looks plausible

SET COMPREHENSIONS
------------------

Replace the ellipsis (...) below, with a set comprehension, which iterates 
through `word_list`, and includes the first three letters for all words 
starting with `k`.  

For example, if word_list were `['keyhole', 'key', 'door', 'keychain', 'kayak']` 
then `k_word_starts` would be `{'key', 'kay'}`

"""
TUPLE COMPREHENSIONS
--------------------

Replace the ellipsis (...) below with a tuple comprehension, which iterates 
through code_string, so that `no_vowels` is a tuple containing the characters
of code_string which are not vowels (aeiou), or spaces.

The str.lower() method might come in useful for this: "A".lower() == "a".

# print("Encoded message:", code_string)
# print("Decoded characters:", no_vowels)

# The str.join method can be used to convert a list of characters back to a str

# print("Decoded message", ''.join(no_vowels))
