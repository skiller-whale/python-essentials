INTRODUCTION TO DICTS

"""
# girls_names_2010 is a dictionary mapping from lowercase name to the number
# of girls born in 2010 with that name. For example:
# {
#     'sydney': 4328,
#     'camila': 4300,
#     'kaitlyn': 3290,
# }
#
# Uncomment the pprint line below and run the script to see what the
# variable girls_names_2010 looks like. It is quite long, so you'll probably
# want to re-comment the line afterwards to keep your display clearer.
